Title: Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

The RMS Titanic was known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time. Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912, killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived.
In this article, we will analyze the Titanic data set and make two predictions. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if we would’ve survived.
Data Set Column Descriptions
pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
survived: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
name: Name
sex: Sex
age: Age
sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
parch: Number of parents/children aboard
fare: Passenger fare (British pound)
embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
adult_male: A male 18 or older (0 = No, 1=Yes)
deck: Deck of the ship
who: man (18+), woman (18+), child (<18)
alive: Yes, no
embarked_town: Port of embarkation ( Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton)
class: Passenger class (1st; 2nd; 3rd)
alone: 1= alone, 0= not alone ( you have at least 1 sibling, spouse, parent or child on board)
age
Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
sibsp
The dataset defines family relations in this way:
Sibling= brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse= husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)
parch
The dataset defines family relations in this way:
Parent= mother, father
Child= daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children traveled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
If you prefer not to read this article and would like a video representation of it, you can check out the YouTube video below. It goes through everything in this article with a little more detail and will help make it easy for you to start programming your own machine-learning model, even if you don’t have the programming language Python installed on your computer.
Or you can use both as supplementary materials for learning about machine learning!

Have fun Coding!
